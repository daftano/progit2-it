== Embedding Git in your Applications

If your application is for developers, chances are good that it could benefit from integration with source control.
Even non-developer applications, such as document editors, could potentially benefit from version-control features, and Git's model works very well for many different scenarios.

If you need to integrate Git with your application, you have essentially three choices: spawning a shell and using the Git command-line tool; Libgit2; and JGit.
