< (((Git as a client)))
< Git provides such a nice experience for developers that many people have figured out how to use it on their workstation, even if the rest of their team is using an entirely different VCS.
< There are a number of these adapters, called ``bridges,'' available.
< Here we'll cover the ones you're most likely to run into in the wild.

> Currently, the majority of open source development projects and a large number of corporate projects use Subversion to manage their source code.

512c434,435
< ==== Git and Mercurial
---
> If you have an existing codebase in another VCS but you’ve decided to start using Git, you must migrate your project one way or another.
> This section goes over some importers that are included with Git for common systems and then demonstrates how to develop your own custom importer.
514,2133c437
< (((Interoperation with other VCSs, Mercurial)))
< (((Mercurial)))
< The DVCS universe is larger than just Git.
< In fact, there are many other systems in this space, each with their own angle on how to do distributed version control correctly.
< Apart from Git, the most popular is Mercurial, and the two are very similar in many respects.
< 
< The good news, if you prefer Git's client-side behavior but are working with a project whose source code is controlled with Mercurial, is that there's a way to use Git as a client for a Mercurial-hosted repository.
< Since the way Git talks to server repositories is through remotes, it should come as no surprise that this bridge is implemented as a remote helper.
< The project's name is git-remote-hg, and it can be found at https://github.com/felipec/git-remote-hg[].
< 
< ===== git-remote-hg
< 
< First, you need to install git-remote-hg.
< This basically entails dropping its file somewhere in your path, like so:
< 
< [source,console]
< ----
< $ curl -o ~/bin/git-remote-hg \
<   https://raw.githubusercontent.com/felipec/git-remote-hg/master/git-remote-hg
< $ chmod +x ~/bin/git-remote-hg
< ----
< 
< …assuming `~/bin` is in your `$PATH`.
< Git-remote-hg has one other dependency: the `mercurial` library for Python.
< If you have Python installed, this is as simple as:
< 
< [source,console]
< ----
< $ pip install mercurial
< ----
< 
< (If you don't have Python installed, visit https://www.python.org/[] and get it first.)
< 
< The last thing you'll need is the Mercurial client.
< Go to https://www.mercurial-scm.org/[] and install it if you haven't already.
< 
< Now you're ready to rock.
< All you need is a Mercurial repository you can push to.
< Fortunately, every Mercurial repository can act this way, so we'll just use the "hello world" repository everyone uses to learn Mercurial:
< 
< [source,console]
< ----
< $ hg clone http://selenic.com/repo/hello /tmp/hello
< ----
< 
< ===== Getting Started
< 
< Now that we have a suitable ``server-side'' repository, we can go through a typical workflow.
< As you'll see, these two systems are similar enough that there isn't much friction.
< 
< As always with Git, first we clone:
< 
< [source,console]
< ----
< $ git clone hg::/tmp/hello /tmp/hello-git
< $ cd /tmp/hello-git
< $ git log --oneline --graph --decorate
< * ac7955c (HEAD, origin/master, origin/branches/default, origin/HEAD, refs/hg/origin/branches/default, refs/hg/origin/bookmarks/master, master) Create a makefile
< * 65bb417 Create a standard "hello, world" program
< ----
< 
< You'll notice that working with a Mercurial repository uses the standard `git clone` command.
< That's because git-remote-hg is working at a fairly low level, using a similar mechanism to how Git's HTTP/S protocol is implemented (remote helpers).
< Since Git and Mercurial are both designed for every client to have a full copy of the repository history, this command makes a full clone, including all the project's history, and does it fairly quickly.
< 
< The log command shows two commits, the latest of which is pointed to by a whole slew of refs.
< It turns out some of these aren't actually there.
< Let's take a look at what's actually in the `.git` directory:

< Git-remote-hg is trying to make things more idiomatically Git-esque, but under the hood it's managing the conceptual mapping between two slightly different systems.
< The `refs/hg` directory is where the actual remote refs are stored.
< For example, the `refs/hg/origin/branches/default` is a Git ref file that contains the SHA-1 starting with ``ac7955c'', which is the commit that `master` points to.
< So the `refs/hg` directory is kind of like a fake `refs/remotes/origin`, but it has the added distinction between bookmarks and branches.
< 
< The `notes/hg` file is the starting point for how git-remote-hg maps Git commit hashes to Mercurial changeset IDs.
< Let's explore a bit:
< 
< [source,console]
< ----
< $ cat notes/hg
< d4c10386...
< 
< $ git cat-file -p d4c10386...
< tree 1781c96...
< author remote-hg <> 1408066400 -0800
< committer remote-hg <> 1408066400 -0800
< 
< Notes for master
< 
< $ git ls-tree 1781c96...
< 100644 blob ac9117f...	65bb417...
< 100644 blob 485e178...	ac7955c...
< 
< $ git cat-file -p ac9117f
< 0a04b987be5ae354b710cefeba0e2d9de7ad41a9
< ----
< 
< So `refs/notes/hg` points to a tree, which in the Git object database is a list of other objects with names.
< `git ls-tree` outputs the mode, type, object hash, and filename for items inside a tree.
< Once we dig down to one of the tree items, we find that inside it is a blob named ``ac9117f'' (the SHA-1 hash of the commit pointed to by `master`), with contents ``0a04b98'' (which is the ID of the Mercurial changeset at the tip of the `default` branch).
< 
< The good news is that we mostly don't have to worry about all of this.
< The typical workflow won't be very different from working with a Git remote.
< 
< There's one more thing we should attend to before we continue: ignores.
< Mercurial and Git use a very similar mechanism for this, but it's likely you don't want to actually commit a `.gitignore` file into a Mercurial repository.
< Fortunately, Git has a way to ignore files that's local to an on-disk repository, and the Mercurial format is compatible with Git, so you just have to copy it over:
< 
< [source,console]
< ----
< $ cp .hgignore .git/info/exclude
< ----
< 
< The `.git/info/exclude` file acts just like a `.gitignore`, but isn't included in commits.
< 
< ===== Workflow
< 
< Let's assume we've done some work and made some commits on the `master` branch, and you're ready to push it to the remote repository.
< Here's what our repository looks like right now:
< 
< [source,console]
< ----
< $ git log --oneline --graph --decorate
< * ba04a2a (HEAD, master) Update makefile
< * d25d16f Goodbye
< * ac7955c (origin/master, origin/branches/default, origin/HEAD, refs/hg/origin/branches/default, refs/hg/origin/bookmarks/master) Create a makefile
< * 65bb417 Create a standard "hello, world" program
< ----
< 
< Our `master` branch is two commits ahead of `origin/master`, but those two commits exist only on our local machine.
< Let's see if anyone else has been doing important work at the same time:
< 
< [source,console]
< ----
< $ git fetch
< From hg::/tmp/hello
<    ac7955c..df85e87  master     -> origin/master
<    ac7955c..df85e87  branches/default -> origin/branches/default
< $ git log --oneline --graph --decorate --all
< * 7b07969 (refs/notes/hg) Notes for default
< * d4c1038 Notes for master
< * df85e87 (origin/master, origin/branches/default, origin/HEAD, refs/hg/origin/branches/default, refs/hg/origin/bookmarks/master) Add some documentation
< | * ba04a2a (HEAD, master) Update makefile
< | * d25d16f Goodbye
< |/
< * ac7955c Create a makefile
< * 65bb417 Create a standard "hello, world" program
< ----
< 
< Since we used the `--all` flag, we see the ``notes'' refs that are used internally by git-remote-hg, but we can ignore them.
< The rest is what we expected; `origin/master` has advanced by one commit, and our history has now diverged.
< Unlike the other systems we work with in this chapter, Mercurial is capable of handling merges, so we're not going to do anything fancy.
< 
< [source,console]
< ----
< $ git merge origin/master
< Auto-merging hello.c
< Merge made by the 'recursive' strategy.
<  hello.c | 2 +-

< 
< Perfect.

< The changeset numbered _2_ was made by Mercurial, and the changesets numbered _3_ and _4_ were made by git-remote-hg, by pushing commits made with Git.
< 
< ===== Branches and Bookmarks
< 
< Git has only one kind of branch: a reference that moves when commits are made.
< In Mercurial, this kind of a reference is called a ``bookmark,'' and it behaves in much the same way as a Git branch.
< 
< Mercurial's concept of a ``branch'' is more heavyweight.
< The branch that a changeset is made on is recorded _with the changeset_, which means it will always be in the repository history.
< Here's an example of a commit that was made on the `develop` branch:

< 
< Note the line that begins with ``branch''.
< Git can't really replicate this (and doesn't need to; both types of branch can be represented as a Git ref), but git-remote-hg needs to understand the difference, because Mercurial cares.

< 
< Changesets _8_, _9_, and _10_ have been created and belong to the `permanent` branch, but the old changesets are still there.
< This can be *very* confusing for your teammates who are using Mercurial, so try to avoid it.
< 
< 
< ===== Mercurial Summary
< 
< Git and Mercurial are similar enough that working across the boundary is fairly painless.
< If you avoid changing history that's left your machine (as is generally recommended), you may not even be aware that the other end is Mercurial.
< 
< 
< ==== Git and Bazaar
< 
< Among the DVCS, another famous one is http://bazaar.canonical.com[Bazaar].
< Bazaar is free and open source, and is part of the https://www.gnu.org[GNU Project].
< It behaves very differently from Git.
< Sometimes, to do the same thing as with Git, you have to use a different keyword, and some keywords that are common don't have the same meaning.
< In particular, the branch management is very different and may cause confusion, especially when someone comes from Git's universe.
< Nevertheless, it is possible to work on a Bazaar repository from a Git one.
< 
< There are many projects that allow you to use Git as a Bazaar client.
< Here we'll use Felipe Contreras' project that you may find at https://github.com/felipec/git-remote-bzr[].
< To install it, you just have to download the file git-remote-bzr in a folder contained in your `$PATH`:
< [source,console]
< ----
< $ wget https://raw.github.com/felipec/git-remote-bzr/master/git-remote-bzr -O ~/bin/git-remote-bzr
< $ chmod +x ~/bin/git-remote-bzr
< ----
< 
< You also need to have Bazaar installed.
< That's all!
< 
< ===== Create a Git repository from a Bazaar repository
< 
< It is simple to use.
< It is enough to clone a Bazaar repository prefixing it by `bzr::`.
< Since Git and Bazaar both do full clones to your machine, it's possible to attach a Git clone to your local Bazaar clone, but it isn't recommended.
< It's much easier to attach your Git clone directly to the same place your Bazaar clone is attached to ‒ the central repository.
< 
< Let's suppose that you worked with a remote repository which is at address `bzr+ssh://developer@mybazaarserver:myproject`.
< Then you must clone it in the following way:
< [source,console]
< ----
< $ git clone bzr::bzr+ssh://developer@mybazaarserver:myproject myProject-Git
< $ cd myProject-Git
< ----
< 
< At this point, your Git repository is created but it is not compacted for optimal disk use.
< That's why you should also clean and compact your Git repository, especially if it is a big one:
< [source,console]
< ----
< $ git gc --aggressive
< ----
< 
< ===== Bazaar branches
< 
< Bazaar only allows you to clone branches, but a repository may contain several branches, and `git-remote-bzr` can clone both.
< For example, to clone a branch:
< [source,console]
< ----
< $ git clone bzr::bzr://bzr.savannah.gnu.org/emacs/trunk emacs-trunk
< ----
< 
< And to clone the whole repository:
< [source,console]
< ----
< $ git clone bzr::bzr://bzr.savannah.gnu.org/emacs emacs
< ----
< 
< The second command clones all the branches contained in the emacs repository; nevertheless, it is possible to point out some branches:
< [source,console]
< ----
< $ git config remote-bzr.branches 'trunk, xwindow'
< ----
< 
< Some remote repositories don't allow you to list their branches, in which case you have to manually specify them, and even though you could specify the configuration in the cloning command, you may find this easier:
< 
< [source,console]
< ----
< $ git init emacs
< $ git remote add origin bzr::bzr://bzr.savannah.gnu.org/emacs
< $ git config remote-bzr.branches 'trunk, xwindow'
< $ git fetch
< ----
< 
< ===== Ignore what is ignored with .bzrignore
< 
< Since you are working on a project managed with Bazaar, you shouldn't create a `.gitignore` file because you _may_ accidentally set it under version control and the other people working with Bazaar would be disturbed.
< The solution is to create the `.git/info/exclude` file either as a symbolic link or as a regular file.
< We'll see later on how to solve this question.
< 
< Bazaar uses the same model as Git to ignore files, but also has two features which don't have an equivalent into Git.
< The complete description may be found in http://doc.bazaar.canonical.com/bzr.2.7/en/user-reference/ignore-help.html[the documentation].
< The two features are:
< 
< 1. "!!" allows you to ignore certain file patterns even if they're specified using a "!" rule.
< 2. "RE:" at the beginning of a line allows you to specify a https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html[Python regular expression] (Git only allows shell globs).
< 
< As a consequence, there are two different situations to consider:
< 
< 1. If the `.bzrignore` file does not contain any of these two specific prefixes, then you can simply make a symbolic link to it in the repository: `ln -s .bzrignore .git/info/exclude`
< 2. Otherwise, you must create the `.git/info/exclude` file and adapt it to ignore exactly the same files in `.bzrignore`.
< 
< Whatever the case is, you will have to remain vigilant against any change of `.bzrignore` to make sure that the `.git/info/exclude` file always reflects `.bzrignore`.
< Indeed, if the `.bzrignore` file were to change and contained one or more lines starting with "!!" or "RE:", Git not being able to interpret these lines, you'll have to adapt your `.git/info/exclude` file to ignore the same files as the ones ignored with `.bzrignore`.
< Moreover, if the `.git/info/exclude` file was a symbolic link, you'll have to first delete the symbolic link, copy `.bzrignore` to `.git/info/exclude` and then adapt the latter.
< However, be careful with its creation because with Git it is impossible to re-include a file if a parent directory of that file is excluded.
< 
< ===== Fetch the changes of the remote repository
< 
< To fetch the changes of the remote, you pull changes as usually, using Git commands.
< Supposing that your changes are on the `master` branch, you merge or rebase your work on the `origin/master` branch:
< [source,console]
< ----
< $ git pull --rebase origin
< ----
< 
< ===== Push your work on the remote repository
< 
< Because Bazaar also has the concept of merge commits, there will be no problem if you push a merge commit.
< So you can work on a branch, merge the changes into `master` and push your work.
< Then, you create your branches, you test and commit your work as usual.
< You finally push your work to the Bazaar repository:
< [source,console]
< ----
< $ git push origin master
< ----
< 
< ===== Caveats
< 
< Git's remote-helpers framework has some limitations that apply.
< In particular, these commands don't work:
< 
< * git push origin :branch-to-delete (Bazaar can't accept ref deletions in this way.)
< * git push origin old:new (it will push 'old')
< * git push --dry-run origin branch (it will push)
< 
< ===== Summary
< 
< Since Git's and Bazaar's models are similar, there isn't a lot of resistance when working across the boundary.
< As long as you watch out for the limitations, and are always aware that the remote repository isn't natively Git, you'll be fine.
< 
< 
< ==== Git and Perforce
< 
< (((Interoperation with other VCSs, Perforce)))
< (((Perforce)))
< Perforce is a very popular version-control system in corporate environments.
< It's been around since 1995, which makes it the oldest system covered in this chapter.
< As such, it's designed with the constraints of its day; it assumes you're always connected to a single central server, and only one version is kept on the local disk.
< To be sure, its features and constraints are well-suited to several specific problems, but there are lots of projects using Perforce where Git would actually work better.
< 
< There are two options if you'd like to mix your use of Perforce and Git.
< The first one we'll cover is the ``Git Fusion'' bridge from the makers of Perforce, which lets you expose subtrees of your Perforce depot as read-write Git repositories.
< The second is git-p4, a client-side bridge that lets you use Git as a Perforce client, without requiring any reconfiguration of the Perforce server.
< 
< [[_p4_git_fusion]]
< ===== Git Fusion
< 
< (((Perforce, Git Fusion)))
< Perforce provides a product called Git Fusion (available at http://www.perforce.com/git-fusion[]), which synchronizes a Perforce server with Git repositories on the server side.
< 
< ====== Setting Up
< 
< For our examples, we'll be using the easiest installation method for Git Fusion, which is downloading a virtual machine that runs the Perforce daemon and Git Fusion.
< You can get the virtual machine image from http://www.perforce.com/downloads/Perforce/20-User[], and once it's finished downloading, import it into your favorite virtualization software (we'll use VirtualBox).
< 
< Upon first starting the machine, it asks you to customize the password for three Linux users (`root`, `perforce`, and `git`), and provide an instance name, which can be used to distinguish this installation from others on the same network.
< When that has all completed, you'll see this:
< 
< .The Git Fusion virtual machine boot screen.
< image::images/git-fusion-boot.png[The Git Fusion virtual machine boot screen.]
< 
< You should take note of the IP address that's shown here, we'll be using it later on.
< Next, we'll create a Perforce user.
< Select the ``Login'' option at the bottom and press enter (or SSH to the machine), and log in as `root`.
< Then use these commands to create a user:
< 
< [source,console]
< ----
< $ p4 -p localhost:1666 -u super user -f john
< $ p4 -p localhost:1666 -u john passwd
< $ exit
< ----
< 
< The first one will open a VI editor to customize the user, but you can accept the defaults by typing `:wq` and hitting enter.
< The second one will prompt you to enter a password twice.
< That's all we need to do with a shell prompt, so exit out of the session.
< 
< The next thing you'll need to do to follow along is to tell Git not to verify SSL certificates.
< The Git Fusion image comes with a certificate, but it's for a domain that won't match your virtual machine's IP address, so Git will reject the HTTPS connection.
< If this is going to be a permanent installation, consult the Perforce Git Fusion manual to install a different certificate; for our example purposes, this will suffice:
< 
< [source,console]
< ----
< $ export GIT_SSL_NO_VERIFY=true
< ----
< 
< Now we can test that everything is working.
< 
< [source,console]
< ----

< 
< ====== Fusion Configuration
< 
< Once you've got Git Fusion installed, you'll want to tweak the configuration.
< This is actually fairly easy to do using your favorite Perforce client; just map the `//.git-fusion` directory on the Perforce server into your workspace.
< The file structure looks like this:
< 
< [source,console]
< ----
< $ tree
< .
< ├── objects
< │   ├── repos
< │   │   └── [...]
< │   └── trees
< │       └── [...]
< │
< ├── p4gf_config
< ├── repos
< │   └── Talkhouse
< │       └── p4gf_config
< └── users
<     └── p4gf_usermap
< 
< 498 directories, 287 files
< ----
< 
< The `objects` directory is used internally by Git Fusion to map Perforce objects to Git and vice versa, you won't have to mess with anything in there.
< There's a global `p4gf_config` file in this directory, as well as one for each repository – these are the configuration files that determine how Git Fusion behaves.
< Let's take a look at the file in the root:
< 
< [source,ini]
< ----
< [repo-creation]
< charset = utf8
< 
< [git-to-perforce]
< change-owner = author
< enable-git-branch-creation = yes
< enable-swarm-reviews = yes
< enable-git-merge-commits = yes
< enable-git-submodules = yes
< preflight-commit = none
< ignore-author-permissions = no
< read-permission-check = none
< git-merge-avoidance-after-change-num = 12107
< 
< [perforce-to-git]
< http-url = none
< ssh-url = none
< 
< [@features]
< imports = False
< chunked-push = False
< matrix2 = False
< parallel-push = False
< 
< [authentication]
< email-case-sensitivity = no
< ----
< 
< We won't go into the meanings of these flags here, but note that this is just an INI-formatted text file, much like Git uses for configuration.
< This file specifies the global options, which can then be overridden by repository-specific configuration files, like `repos/Talkhouse/p4gf_config`.
< If you open this file, you'll see a `[@repo]` section with some settings that are different from the global defaults.
< You'll also see sections that look like this:
< 
< [source,ini]
< ----
< [Talkhouse-master]
< git-branch-name = master
< view = //depot/Talkhouse/main-dev/... ...
< ----
< 
< This is a mapping between a Perforce branch and a Git branch.
< The section can be named whatever you like, so long as the name is unique.
< `git-branch-name` lets you convert a depot path that would be cumbersome under Git to a more friendly name.
< The `view` setting controls how Perforce files are mapped into the Git repository, using the standard view mapping syntax.
< More than one mapping can be specified, like in this example:
< 
< [source,ini]
< ----
< [multi-project-mapping]
< git-branch-name = master
< view = //depot/project1/main/... project1/...
<        //depot/project2/mainline/... project2/...
< ----
< 
< This way, if your normal workspace mapping includes changes in the structure of the directories, you can replicate that with a Git repository.
< 
< The last file we'll discuss is `users/p4gf_usermap`, which maps Perforce users to Git users, and which you may not even need.
< When converting from a Perforce changeset to a Git commit, Git Fusion's default behavior is to look up the Perforce user, and use the email address and full name stored there for the author/committer field in Git.
< When converting the other way, the default is to look up the Perforce user with the email address stored in the Git commit's author field, and submit the changeset as that user (with permissions applying).
< In most cases, this behavior will do just fine, but consider the following mapping file:
< 
< [source]
< ----
< john john@example.com "John Doe"
< john johnny@appleseed.net "John Doe"
< bob employeeX@example.com "Anon X. Mouse"
< joe employeeY@example.com "Anon Y. Mouse"
< ----
< 
< Each line is of the format `<user> <email> "<full name>"`, and creates a single user mapping.
< The first two lines map two distinct email addresses to the same Perforce user account.
< This is useful if you've created Git commits under several different email addresses (or change email addresses), but want them to be mapped to the same Perforce user.
< When creating a Git commit from a Perforce changeset, the first line matching the Perforce user is used for Git authorship information.
< 
< The last two lines mask Bob and Joe's actual names and email addresses from the Git commits that are created.
< This is nice if you want to open-source an internal project, but don't want to publish your employee directory to the entire world.
< Note that the email addresses and full names should be unique, unless you want all the Git commits to be attributed to a single fictional author.
< 
< ====== Workflow
< 
< Perforce Git Fusion is a two-way bridge between Perforce and Git version control.
< Let's have a look at how it feels to work from the Git side.
< We'll assume we've mapped in the ``Jam'' project using a configuration file as shown above, which we can clone like this:
< 
< [source,console]

< [...]
< ----
< 
< The first time you do this, it may take some time.
< What's happening is that Git Fusion is converting all the applicable changesets in the Perforce history into Git commits.
< This happens locally on the server, so it's relatively fast, but if you have a lot of history, it can still take some time.
< Subsequent fetches do incremental conversion, so it'll feel more like Git's native speed.
< 
< As you can see, our repository looks exactly like any other Git repository you might work with.
< There are three branches, and Git has helpfully created a local `master` branch that tracks `origin/master`.
< Let's do a bit of work, and create a couple of new commits:
< 
< [source,console]
< ----
< # ...
< $ git log --oneline --decorate --graph --all

< 
< We have two new commits.
< Now let's check if anyone else has been working:

< ----
< 
< It looks like someone was!
< You wouldn't know it from this view, but the `6afeb15` commit was actually created using a Perforce client.
< It just looks like another commit from Git's point of view, which is exactly the point.
< Let's see how the Perforce server deals with a merge commit:
< 
< [source,console]

<    6afeb15..89cba2b  master -> master
< ----
< 
< Git thinks it worked.
< Let's take a look at the history of the `README` file from Perforce's point of view, using the revision graph feature of `p4v`:
< 
< .Perforce revision graph resulting from Git push.
< image::images/git-fusion-perforce-graph.png[Perforce revision graph resulting from Git push.]
< 
< If you've never seen this view before, it may seem confusing, but it shows the same concepts as a graphical viewer for Git history.
< We're looking at the history of the `README` file, so the directory tree at top left only shows that file as it surfaces in various branches.
< At top right, we have a visual graph of how different revisions of the file are related, and the big-picture view of this graph is at bottom right.
< The rest of the view is given to the details view for the selected revision (`2` in this case).
< 
< One thing to notice is that the graph looks exactly like the one in Git's history.
< Perforce didn't have a named branch to store the `1` and `2` commits, so it made an ``anonymous'' branch in the `.git-fusion` directory to hold it.
< This will also happen for named Git branches that don't correspond to a named Perforce branch (and you can later map them to a Perforce branch using the configuration file).
< 
< Most of this happens behind the scenes, but the end result is that one person on a team can be using Git, another can be using Perforce, and neither of them will know about the other's choice.
< 
< ====== Git-Fusion Summary
< 
< If you have (or can get) access to your Perforce server, Git Fusion is a great way to make Git and Perforce talk to each other.
< There's a bit of configuration involved, but the learning curve isn't very steep.
< This is one of the few sections in this chapter where cautions about using Git's full power will not appear.
< That's not to say that Perforce will be happy with everything you throw at it – if you try to rewrite history that's already been pushed, Git Fusion will reject it – but Git Fusion tries very hard to feel native.
< You can even use Git submodules (though they'll look strange to Perforce users), and merge branches (this will be recorded as an integration on the Perforce side).
< 
< If you can't convince the administrator of your server to set up Git Fusion, there is still a way to use these tools together.
< 
< [[_git_p4_client]]
< ===== Git-p4
< 
< (((git commands, p4)))
< Git-p4 is a two-way bridge between Git and Perforce.
< It runs entirely inside your Git repository, so you won't need any kind of access to the Perforce server (other than user credentials, of course).
< Git-p4 isn't as flexible or complete a solution as Git Fusion, but it does allow you to do most of what you'd want to do without being invasive to the server environment.
< 
< [NOTE]
< ======
< You'll need the `p4` tool somewhere in your `PATH` to work with git-p4.
< As of this writing, it is freely available at http://www.perforce.com/downloads/Perforce/20-User[].
< ======
< 
< ====== Setting Up
< 
< For example purposes, we'll be running the Perforce server from the Git Fusion OVA as shown above, but we'll bypass the Git Fusion server and go directly to the Perforce version control.
< 
< In order to use the `p4` command-line client (which git-p4 depends on), you'll need to set a couple of environment variables:
< 
< [source,console]
< ----
< $ export P4PORT=10.0.1.254:1666
< $ export P4USER=john
< ----
< 
< ====== Getting Started
< 
< As with anything in Git, the first command is to clone:
< 
< [source,console]
< ----
< $ git p4 clone //depot/www/live www-shallow
< Importing from //depot/www/live into www-shallow
< Initialized empty Git repository in /private/tmp/www-shallow/.git/
< Doing initial import of //depot/www/live/ from revision #head into refs/remotes/p4/master
< ----
< 
< This creates what in Git terms is a ``shallow'' clone; only the very latest Perforce revision is imported into Git; remember, Perforce isn't designed to give every revision to every user.
< This is enough to use Git as a Perforce client, but for other purposes it's not enough.
< 
< Once it's finished, we have a fully-functional Git repository:
< 
< [source,console]
< ----
< $ cd myproject
< $ git log --oneline --all --graph --decorate
< * 70eaf78 (HEAD, p4/master, p4/HEAD, master) Initial import of //depot/www/live/ from the state at revision #head
< ----
< 
< Note how there's a ``p4'' remote for the Perforce server, but everything else looks like a standard clone.
< Actually, that's a bit misleading; there isn't actually a remote there.
< 
< [source,console]
< ----
< $ git remote -v
< ----
< 
< No remotes exist in this repository at all.
< Git-p4 has created some refs to represent the state of the server, and they look like remote refs to `git log`, but they're not managed by Git itself, and you can't push to them.
< 
< ====== Workflow
< 
< Okay, let's do some work.
< Let's assume you've made some progress on a very important feature, and you're ready to show it to the rest of your team.
< 
< [source,console]
< ----

< We've made two new commits that we're ready to submit to the Perforce server.
< Let's check if anyone else was working today:
< 
< [source,console]
< ----

< git p4 sync

< ----
< 
< Looks like they were, and `master` and `p4/master` have diverged.
< Perforce's branching system is _nothing_ like Git's, so submitting merge commits doesn't make any sense.
< Git-p4 recommends that you rebase your commits, and even comes with a shortcut to do so:
< 
< [source,console]
< ----
< $ git p4 rebase
< Performing incremental import into refs/remotes/p4/master git branch
< Depot paths: //depot/www/live/
< No changes to import!
< Rebasing the current branch onto remotes/p4/master
< First, rewinding head to replay your work on top of it...
< Applying: Update link
< Applying: Change page title
<  index.html | 2 +-
<  1 file changed, 1 insertion(+), 1 deletion(-)
< ----
< 
< You can probably tell from the output, but `git p4 rebase` is a shortcut for `git p4 sync` followed by `git rebase p4/master`.
< It's a bit smarter than that, especially when working with multiple branches, but this is a good approximation.
< 
< Now our history is linear again, and we're ready to contribute our changes back to Perforce.
< The `git p4 submit` command will try to create a new Perforce revision for every Git commit between `p4/master` and `master`.
< Running it drops us into our favorite editor, and the contents of the file look something like this:
< 
< [source,console]

< ----
< 
< The Git and Perforce history diverge after 775a46f.
< The Git side has two commits, then a merge commit with the Perforce head, then another commit.
< We're going to try to submit these on top of a single changeset on the Perforce side.
< Let's see what would happen if we tried to submit now:
< 
< [source,console]
< ----
< $ git p4 submit -n
< Perforce checkout for depot path //depot/www/live/ located at /Users/ben/john_bens-mbp_8487/john_bens-mbp_8487/depot/www/live/

< ----
< 
< The `-n` flag is short for `--dry-run`, which tries to report what would happen if the submit command were run for real.
< In this case, it looks like we'd be creating three Perforce changesets, which correspond to the three non-merge commits that don't yet exist on the Perforce server.
< That sounds like exactly what we want, let's see how it turns out:
< 
< [source,console]

< 
< Our history became linear, just as though we had rebased before submitting (which is in fact exactly what happened).
< This means you can be free to create, work on, throw away, and merge branches on the Git side without fear that your history will somehow become incompatible with Perforce.
< If you can rebase it, you can contribute it to a Perforce server.
< 
< [[_git_p4_branches]]
< ====== Branching
< 
< If your Perforce project has multiple branches, you're not out of luck; git-p4 can handle that in a way that makes it feel like Git.

< 
< [source]

<       ├── main
<       └── dev
< ----
< 
< And let's say you have a `dev` branch, which has a view spec that looks like this:
< 
< [source]
< ----
< //depot/project/main/... //depot/project/dev/...
< ----
< 
< Git-p4 can automatically detect that situation and do the right thing:
< 
< [source,console]
< ----
< $ git p4 clone --detect-branches //depot/project@all
< Importing from //depot/project@all into project
< Initialized empty Git repository in /private/tmp/project/.git/
< Importing revision 20 (50%)
<     Importing new branch project/dev
< 
<     Resuming with change 20
< Importing revision 22 (100%)
< Updated branches: main dev
< $ cd project; git log --oneline --all --graph --decorate
< * eae77ae (HEAD, p4/master, p4/HEAD, master) main
< | * 10d55fb (p4/project/dev) dev
< | * a43cfae Populate //depot/project/main/... //depot/project/dev/....
< |/
< * 2b83451 Project init
< ----
< 
< Note the ``@all'' specifier in the depot path; that tells git-p4 to clone not just the latest changeset for that subtree, but all changesets that have ever touched those paths.
< This is closer to Git's concept of a clone, but if you're working on a project with a long history, it could take a while.
< 
< The `--detect-branches` flag tells git-p4 to use Perforce's branch specs to map the branches to Git refs.
< If these mappings aren't present on the Perforce server (which is a perfectly valid way to use Perforce), you can tell git-p4 what the branch mappings are, and you get the same result:
< 
< [source,console]
< ----
< $ git init project
< Initialized empty Git repository in /tmp/project/.git/
< $ cd project
< $ git config git-p4.branchList main:dev
< $ git clone --detect-branches //depot/project@all .
< ----
< 
< Setting the `git-p4.branchList` configuration variable to `main:dev` tells git-p4 that ``main'' and ``dev'' are both branches, and the second one is a child of the first one.
< 
< If we now `git checkout -b dev p4/project/dev` and make some commits, git-p4 is smart enough to target the right branch when we do `git p4 submit`.
< Unfortunately, git-p4 can't mix shallow clones and multiple branches; if you have a huge project and want to work on more than one branch, you'll have to `git p4 clone` once for each branch you want to submit to.
< 
< For creating or integrating branches, you'll have to use a Perforce client.
< Git-p4 can only sync and submit to existing branches, and it can only do it one linear changeset at a time.
< If you merge two branches in Git and try to submit the new changeset, all that will be recorded is a bunch of file changes; the metadata about which branches are involved in the integration will be lost.
< 
< ===== Git and Perforce Summary
< 
< Git-p4 makes it possible to use a Git workflow with a Perforce server, and it's pretty good at it.
< However, it's important to remember that Perforce is in charge of the source, and you're only using Git to work locally.
< Just be really careful about sharing Git commits; if you have a remote that other people use, don't push any commits that haven't already been submitted to the Perforce server.
< 
< If you want to freely mix the use of Perforce and Git as clients for source control, and you can convince the server administrator to install it, Git Fusion makes using Git a first-class version-control client for a Perforce server.
< 
< 
< ==== Git and TFS
< 
< (((Interoperation with other VCSs, TFS)))
< (((TFS)))((("TFVC", see="TFS")))
< Git is becoming popular with Windows developers, and if you're writing code on Windows, there's a good chance you're using Microsoft's Team Foundation Server (TFS).
< TFS is a collaboration suite that includes defect and work-item tracking, process support for Scrum and others, code review, and version control.
< There's a bit of confusion ahead: *TFS* is the server, which supports controlling source code using both Git and their own custom VCS, which they've dubbed *TFVC* (Team Foundation Version Control).
< Git support is a somewhat new feature for TFS (shipping with the 2013 version), so all of the tools that predate that refer to the version-control portion as ``TFS'', even though they're mostly working with TFVC.
< 
< If you find yourself on a team that's using TFVC but you'd rather use Git as your version-control client, there's a project for you.
< 
< ===== Which Tool
< 
< (((git-tf)))(((git-tfs)))
< In fact, there are two: git-tf and git-tfs.
< 
< Git-tfs (found at https://github.com/git-tfs/git-tfs[]) is a .NET project, and (as of this writing) it only runs on Windows.
< To work with Git repositories, it uses the .NET bindings for libgit2, a library-oriented implementation of Git which is highly performant and allows a lot of flexibility with the guts of a Git repository.
< Libgit2 is not a complete implementation of Git, so to cover the difference git-tfs will actually call the command-line Git client for some operations, so there are no artificial limits on what it can do with Git repositories.
< Its support of TFVC features is very mature, since it uses the Visual Studio assemblies for operations with servers.
< This does mean you'll need access to those assemblies, which means you need to install a recent version of Visual Studio (any edition since version 2010, including Express since version 2012), or the Visual Studio SDK.
< 
< Git-tf (whose home is at https://gittf.codeplex.com[]) is a Java project, and as such runs on any computer with a Java runtime environment.
< It interfaces with Git repositories through JGit (a JVM implementation of Git), which means it has virtually no limitations in terms of Git functions.
< However, its support for TFVC is limited as compared to git-tfs – it does not support branches, for instance.
< 
< So each tool has pros and cons, and there are plenty of situations that favor one over the other.
< We'll cover the basic usage of both of them in this book.
< 
< [NOTE]
< ====
< You'll need access to a TFVC-based repository to follow along with these instructions.
< These aren't as plentiful in the wild as Git or Subversion repositories, so you may need to create one of your own.
< Codeplex (https://www.codeplex.com[]) or Visual Studio Online (https://visualstudio.microsoft.com[]) are both good choices for this.
< ====
< 
< 
< ===== Getting Started: `git-tf`
< 
< The first thing you do, just as with any Git project, is clone.
< Here's what that looks like with `git-tf`:
< 
< [source,console]
< ----
< $ git tf clone https://tfs.codeplex.com:443/tfs/TFS13 $/myproject/Main project_git
< ----
< 
< The first argument is the URL of a TFVC collection, the second is of the form `$/project/branch`, and the third is the path to the local Git repository that is to be created (this last one is optional).
< Git-tf can only work with one branch at a time; if you want to make checkins on a different TFVC branch, you'll have to make a new clone from that branch.
< 
< This creates a fully functional Git repository:
< 
< [source,console]
< ----
< $ cd project_git
< $ git log --all --oneline --decorate
< 512e75a (HEAD, tag: TFS_C35190, origin_tfs/tfs, master) Checkin message
< ----
< 
< This is called a _shallow_ clone, meaning that only the latest changeset has been downloaded.
< TFVC isn't designed for each client to have a full copy of the history, so git-tf defaults to only getting the latest version, which is much faster.
< 
< If you have some time, it's probably worth it to clone the entire project history, using the `--deep` option:
< 
< [source,console]
< ----
< $ git tf clone https://tfs.codeplex.com:443/tfs/TFS13 $/myproject/Main \
<   project_git --deep
< Username: domain\user
< Password:
< Connecting to TFS...
< Cloning $/myproject into /tmp/project_git: 100%, done.
< Cloned 4 changesets. Cloned last changeset 35190 as d44b17a
< $ cd project_git
< $ git log --all --oneline --decorate
< d44b17a (HEAD, tag: TFS_C35190, origin_tfs/tfs, master) Goodbye
< 126aa7b (tag: TFS_C35189)
< 8f77431 (tag: TFS_C35178) FIRST
< 0745a25 (tag: TFS_C35177) Created team project folder $/tfvctest via the \
<         Team Project Creation Wizard
< ----
< 
< Notice the tags with names like `TFS_C35189`; this is a feature that helps you know which Git commits are associated with TFVC changesets.
< This is a nice way to represent it, since you can see with a simple log command which of your commits is associated with a snapshot that also exists in TFVC.
< They aren't necessary (and in fact you can turn them off with `git config git-tf.tag false`) – git-tf keeps the real commit-changeset mappings in the `.git/git-tf` file.
< 
< 
< ===== Getting Started: `git-tfs`
< 
< Git-tfs cloning behaves a bit differently.
< Observe:
< 
< [source,powershell]
< ----
< PS> git tfs clone --with-branches \

< C18 = 44cd729d8df868a8be20438fdeeefb961958b674
< ----
< 
< Notice the `--with-branches` flag.
< Git-tfs is capable of mapping TFVC branches to Git branches, and this flag tells it to set up a local Git branch for every TFVC branch.
< This is highly recommended if you've ever branched or merged in TFS, but it won't work with a server older than TFS 2010 – before that release, ``branches'' were just folders, so git-tfs can't tell them from regular folders.
< 
< Let's take a look at the resulting Git repository:

< Author: Ben Straub <ben@straub.cc>
< Date:   Fri Aug 1 03:41:59 2014 +0000
< 
<     Hello
< 
<     git-tfs-id: [https://username.visualstudio.com/DefaultCollection]$/myproject/Trunk;C16
< ----
< 
< There are two local branches, `master` and `featureA`, which represent the initial starting point of the clone (`Trunk` in TFVC) and a child branch (`featureA` in TFVC).
< You can also see that the `tfs` ``remote'' has a couple of refs too: `default` and `featureA`, which represent TFVC branches.
< Git-tfs maps the branch you cloned from to `tfs/default`, and others get their own names.
< 
< Another thing to notice is the `git-tfs-id:` lines in the commit messages.
< Instead of tags, git-tfs uses these markers to relate TFVC changesets to Git commits.
< This has the implication that your Git commits will have a different SHA-1 hash before and after they have been pushed to TFVC.
< 
< ===== Git-tf[s] Workflow
< 
< [NOTE]
< ====
< Regardless of which tool you're using, you should set a couple of Git configuration values to avoid running into issues.
< 
< [source,console]
< ----
< $ git config set --local core.ignorecase=true
< $ git config set --local core.autocrlf=false
< ----
< ====
< 
< The obvious next thing you're going to want to do is work on the project.
< TFVC and TFS have several features that may add complexity to your workflow:
< 
< . Feature branches that aren't represented in TFVC add a bit of complexity.
<   This has to do with the *very* different ways that TFVC and Git represent branches.
< . Be aware that TFVC allows users to ``checkout'' files from the server, locking them so nobody else can edit them.
<   This obviously won't stop you from editing them in your local repository, but it could get in the way when it comes time to push your changes up to the TFVC server.
< . TFS has the concept of ``gated'' checkins, where a TFS build-test cycle has to complete successfully before the checkin is allowed.
<   This uses the ``shelve'' function in TFVC, which we don't cover in detail here.
<     You can fake this in a manual fashion with git-tf, and git-tfs provides the `checkintool` command which is gate-aware.
< 
< In the interest of brevity, what we'll cover here is the happy path, which sidesteps or avoids most of these issues.
< 
< ===== Workflow: `git-tf`
< 
< 
< Let's say you've done some work, made a couple of Git commits on `master`, and you're ready to share your progress on the TFVC server.
< Here's our Git repository:
< 
< [source,console]

< 
< We want to take the snapshot that's in the `4178a82` commit and push it up to the TFVC server.
< First things first: let's see if any of our teammates did anything since we last connected:
<

<           Team Project Creation Wizard
< ----
< 
< Looks like someone else is working, too, and now we have divergent history.
< This is where Git shines, but we have two choices of how to proceed:
< 
< . Making a merge commit feels natural as a Git user (after all, that's what `git pull` does), and git-tf can do this for you with a simple `git tf pull`.
<   Be aware, however, that TFVC doesn't think this way, and if you push merge commits your history will start to look different on both sides, which can be confusing.
<   However, if you plan on submitting all of your changes as one changeset, this is probably the easiest choice.
< . Rebasing makes our commit history linear, which means we have the option of converting each of our Git commits into a TFVC changeset.
<   Since this leaves the most options open, we recommend you do it this way; git-tf even makes it easy for you with `git tf pull --rebase`.
< 
< The choice is yours.
< For this example, we'll be rebasing:
< 
< [source,console]
< ----
< $ git rebase FETCH_HEAD

<           Team Project Creation Wizard
< ----
< 
< Now we're ready to make a checkin to the TFVC server.
< Git-tf gives you the choice of making a single changeset that represents all the changes since the last one (`--shallow`, which is the default) and creating a new changeset for each Git commit (`--deep`).
< For this example, we'll just create one changeset:
< 
< [source,console]

< * 0745a25 (tag: TFS_C35177) Created team project folder $/tfvctest via the \
<           Team Project Creation Wizard
< ----
< 
< There's a new `TFS_C35348` tag, indicating that TFVC is storing the exact same snapshot as the `5a0e25e` commit.
< It's important to note that not every Git commit needs to have an exact counterpart in TFVC; the `6eb3eb5` commit, for example, doesn't exist anywhere on the server.
< 
< That's the main workflow.
< There are a couple of other considerations you'll want to keep in mind:
< 
< * There is no branching.
<   Git-tf can only create Git repositories from one TFVC branch at a time.
< * Collaborate using either TFVC or Git, but not both.
<   Different git-tf clones of the same TFVC repository may have different commit SHA-1 hashes, which will cause no end of headaches.
< * If your team's workflow includes collaborating in Git and syncing periodically with TFVC, only connect to TFVC with one of the Git repositories.
< 
< ===== Workflow: `git-tfs`
< 
< Let's walk through the same scenario using git-tfs.
< Here are the new commits we've made to the `master` branch in our Git repository:

< Yes, it turns out our coworker has added a new TFVC changeset, which shows up as the new `aea74a0` commit, and the `tfs/default` remote branch has moved.
< 
< As with git-tf, we have two fundamental options for how to resolve this divergent history:
< 
< . Rebase to preserve a linear history.
< . Merge to preserve what actually happened.
< 
< In this case, we're going to do a ``deep'' checkin, where every Git commit becomes a TFVC changeset, so we want to rebase.

< ----
< 
< Notice how after every successful checkin to the TFVC server, git-tfs is rebasing the remaining work onto what it just did.
< That's because it's adding the `git-tfs-id` field to the bottom of the commit messages, which changes the SHA-1 hashes.
< This is exactly as designed, and there's nothing to worry about, but you should be aware that it's happening, especially if you're sharing Git commits with others.
< 
< TFS has many features that integrate with its version control system, such as work items, designated reviewers, gated checkins, and so on.
< It can be cumbersome to work with these features using only a command-line tool, but fortunately git-tfs lets you launch a graphical checkin tool very easily:

< As an example, let's create one:

< ----
< 
< Creating a branch in TFVC means adding a changeset where that branch now exists, and this is projected as a Git commit.
< Note also that git-tfs *created* the `tfs/featureBee` remote branch, but `HEAD` is still pointing to `master`.
< If you want to work on the newly-minted branch, you'll want to base your new commits on the `1d54865` commit, perhaps by creating a topic branch from that commit.
< 
< ===== Git and TFS Summary
< 
< Git-tf and Git-tfs are both great tools for interfacing with a TFVC server.
< They allow you to use the power of Git locally, avoid constantly having to round-trip to the central TFVC server, and make your life as a developer much easier, without forcing your entire team to migrate to Git.
< If you're working on Windows (which is likely if your team is using TFS), you'll probably want to use git-tfs, since its feature set is more complete, but if you're working on another platform, you'll be using git-tf, which is more limited.
< As with most of the tools in this chapter, you should choose one of these version-control systems to be canonical, and use the other one in a subordinate fashion – either Git or TFVC should be the center of collaboration, but not both.
< 
< [[_migrating]]
< === Migrating to Git
< 
< (((Migrating to Git)))
< If you have an existing codebase in another VCS but you've decided to start using Git, you must migrate your project one way or another.
< This section goes over some importers for common systems, and then demonstrates how to develop your own custom importer.
< You'll learn how to import data from several of the bigger professionally used SCM systems, because they make up the majority of users who are switching, and because high-quality tools for them are easy to come by.

< ==== Mercurial
< 
< (((Mercurial)))(((Importing, from Mercurial)))
< Since Mercurial and Git have fairly similar models for representing versions, and since Git is a bit more flexible, converting a repository from Mercurial to Git is fairly straightforward, using a tool called "hg-fast-export", which you'll need a copy of:
< 
< [source,console]
< ----
< $ git clone https://github.com/frej/fast-export.git
< ----
< 
< The first step in the conversion is to get a full clone of the Mercurial repository you want to convert:
< 
< [source,console]
< ----
< $ hg clone <remote repo URL> /tmp/hg-repo
< ----
< 
< The next step is to create an author mapping file.
< Mercurial is a bit more forgiving than Git for what it will put in the author field for changesets, so this is a good time to clean house.
< Generating this is a one-line command in a `bash` shell:
< 
< [source,console]
< ----
< $ cd /tmp/hg-repo
< $ hg log | grep user: | sort | uniq | sed 's/user: *//' > ../authors
< ----
< 
< This will take a few seconds, depending on how long your project's history is, and afterwards the `/tmp/authors` file will look something like this:
< 
< [source]
< ----
< bob
< bob@localhost
< bob <bob@company.com>
< bob jones <bob <AT> company <DOT> com>
< Bob Jones <bob@company.com>
< Joe Smith <joe@company.com>
< ----
< 
< In this example, the same person (Bob) has created changesets under four different names, one of which actually looks correct, and one of which would be completely invalid for a Git commit.
< Hg-fast-export lets us fix this by turning each line into a rule: `"<input>"="<output>"`, mapping an `<input>` to an `<output>`.
< Inside the `<input>` and `<output>` strings, all escape sequences understood by the python `string_escape` encoding are supported.
< If the author mapping file does not contain a matching `<input>`, that author will be sent on to Git unmodified.
< If all the usernames look fine, we won't need this file at all.
< In this example, we want our file to look like this:
< 
< [source]
< ----
< "bob"="Bob Jones <bob@company.com>"
< "bob@localhost"="Bob Jones <bob@company.com>"
< "bob <bob@company.com>"="Bob Jones <bob@company.com>"
< "bob jones <bob <AT> company <DOT> com>"="Bob Jones <bob@company.com>"
< ----
< 
< The same kind of mapping file can be used to rename branches and tags when the Mercurial name is not allowed by Git.
< 
< The next step is to create our new Git repository, and run the export script:
< 
< [source,console]
< ----
< $ git init /tmp/converted
< $ cd /tmp/converted
< $ /tmp/fast-export/hg-fast-export.sh -r /tmp/hg-repo -A /tmp/authors
< ----
< 
< The `-r` flag tells hg-fast-export where to find the Mercurial repository we want to convert, and the `-A` flag tells it where to find the author-mapping file (branch and tag mapping files are specified by the `-B` and `-T` flags respectively).
< The script parses Mercurial changesets and converts them into a script for Git's "fast-import" feature (which we'll discuss in detail a bit later on).
< This takes a bit (though it's _much_ faster than it would be over the network), and the output is fairly verbose:
< 
< [source,console]

< 
< That's pretty much all there is to it.
< All of the Mercurial tags have been converted to Git tags, and Mercurial branches and bookmarks have been converted to Git branches.
< Now you're ready to push the repository up to its new server-side home:
< 
< [source,console]
< ----
< $ git remote add origin git@my-git-server:myrepository.git
< $ git push origin --all
< ----
< 
< 
< ==== Bazaar
< (((Bazaar)))(((Importing, from Bazaar)))
< 
< Bazaar is a DVCS tool much like Git, and as a result it's pretty straightforward to convert a Bazaar repository into a Git one.
< To accomplish this, you'll need to import the `bzr-fastimport` plugin.
< 
< ===== Getting the bzr-fastimport plugin
< 
< The procedure for installing the fastimport plugin is different on UNIX-like operating systems and on Windows.
< In the first case, the simplest is to install the `bzr-fastimport` package that will install all the required dependencies.
< 
< For example, with Debian and derived, you would do the following:
< 
< [source,console]
< ----
< $ sudo apt-get install bzr-fastimport
< ----
< 
< With RHEL, you would do the following:
< 
< [source,console]
< ----
< $ sudo yum install bzr-fastimport
< ----
< 
< With Fedora, since release 22, the new package manager is dnf:
< 
< [source,console]
< ----
< $ sudo dnf install bzr-fastimport
< ----
< 
< If the package is not available, you may install it as a plugin:
< 
< [source,console]
< ----
< $ mkdir --parents ~/.bazaar/plugins     # creates the necessary folders for the plugins
< $ cd ~/.bazaar/plugins
< $ bzr branch lp:bzr-fastimport fastimport   # imports the fastimport plugin
< $ cd fastimport
< $ sudo python setup.py install --record=files.txt   # installs the plugin
< ----
< 
< For this plugin to work, you'll also need the `fastimport` Python module.
< You can check whether it is present or not and install it with the following commands:
< 
< [source,console]
< ----
< $ python -c "import fastimport"
< Traceback (most recent call last):
<   File "<string>", line 1, in <module>
< ImportError: No module named fastimport
< $ pip install fastimport
< ----
< If it is not available, you can download it at address https://pypi.python.org/pypi/fastimport/.
< 
< In the second case (on Windows), `bzr-fastimport` is automatically installed with the standalone version and the default installation (let all the checkboxes checked).
< So in this case you have nothing to do.
< 
< At this point, the way to import a Bazaar repository differs according to that you have a single branch or you are working with a repository that has several branches.
< 
< ===== Project with a single branch
< 
< Now `cd` in the directory that contains your Bazaar repository and initialize the Git repository:
< 
< [source,console]
< ----
< $ cd /path/to/the/bzr/repository
< $ git init
< ----
< 
< Now, you can simply export your Bazaar repository and convert it into a Git repository using the following command:
< 
< [source,console]
< ----
< $ bzr fast-export --plain . | git fast-import
< ----
< 
< Depending on the size of the project, your Git repository is built in a lapse from a few seconds to a few minutes.
< 
< ===== Case of a project with a main branch and a working branch
< 
< You can also import a Bazaar repository that contains branches.
< Let us suppose that you have two branches: one represents the main branch (myProject.trunk), the other one is the working branch (myProject.work).
< 
< [source,console]
< ----
< $ ls
< myProject.trunk myProject.work
< ----
< 
< Create the Git repository and `cd` into it:
< 
< [source,console]
< ----
< $ git init git-repo
< $ cd git-repo
< ----
< 
< Pull the master branch into git:
< 
< [source,console]
< ----
< $ bzr fast-export --export-marks=../marks.bzr ../myProject.trunk | \
< git fast-import --export-marks=../marks.git
< ----
< 
< Pull the working branch into Git:
< 
< [source,console]
< ----
< $ bzr fast-export --marks=../marks.bzr --git-branch=work ../myProject.work | \
< git fast-import --import-marks=../marks.git --export-marks=../marks.git
< ----
< 
< Now `git branch` shows you the `master` branch as well as the `work` branch.
< Check the logs to make sure they're complete and get rid of the `marks.bzr` and `marks.git` files.
< 
< ===== Synchronizing the staging area
< 
< Whatever the number of branches you had and the import method you used, your staging area is not synchronized with `HEAD`, and with the import of several branches, your working directory is not synchronized either.
< This situation is easily solved by the following command:
< 
< [source,console]
< ----
< $ git reset --hard HEAD
< ----
< 
< ===== Ignoring the files that were ignored with .bzrignore
< 
< Now let's have a look at the files to ignore.
< The first thing to do is to rename `.bzrignore` into `.gitignore`.
< If the `.bzrignore` file contains one or several lines starting with "!!" or "RE:", you'll have to modify it and perhaps create several `.gitignore` files in order to ignore exactly the same files that Bazaar was ignoring.
< 
< Finally, you will have to create a commit that contains this modification for the migration:
< 
< [source,console]
< ----
< $ git mv .bzrignore .gitignore
< $ # modify .gitignore if needed
< $ git commit -am 'Migration from Bazaar to Git'
< ----
< 
< ===== Sending your repository to the server
< 
< Here we are!
< Now you can push the repository onto its new home server:
< 
< [source,console]
< ----
< $ git remote add origin git@my-git-server:mygitrepository.git
< $ git push origin --all
< $ git push origin --tags
< ----
< 
< Your Git repository is ready to use.
< 
< 
< [[_perforce_import]]
< ==== Perforce
< 
< (((Perforce)))(((Importing, from Perforce)))
< The next system you'll look at importing from is Perforce.
< As we discussed above, there are two ways to let Git and Perforce talk to each other: git-p4 and Perforce Git Fusion.
< 
< ===== Perforce Git Fusion
< 
< Git Fusion makes this process fairly painless.
< Just configure your project settings, user mappings, and branches using a configuration file (as discussed in <<_p4_git_fusion>>), and clone the repository.
< Git Fusion leaves you with what looks like a native Git repository, which is then ready to push to a native Git host if you desire.
< You could even use Perforce as your Git host if you like.
< 
< [[_git_p4]]
< ===== Git-p4
< 
< Git-p4 can also act as an import tool.
< As an example, we'll import the Jam project from the Perforce Public Depot.
---
> The next system you’ll look at importing from is Perforce.
> A Perforce importer is also distributed with Git.
> If you have a version of Git earlier than 1.7.11, then the importer is only available in the `contrib` section of the source code.
> In that case you must get the Git source code, which you can download from git.kernel.org:
> 
> 	$ git clone git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/git/git.git
> 	$ cd git/contrib/fast-import
> 
> In this `fast-import` directory, you should find an executable Python script named `git-p4`.
> You must have Python and the `p4` tool installed on your machine for this import to work.
> For example, you’ll import the Jam project from the Perforce Public Depot.

< This grabs all of the changesets in the history of the project and put it in the AUTHORS_TMP file that we will process to extract the data of the 'User' column (the 2nd one).

< The `cut` command keeps only the characters between 11 and 20 from each line.
< The `tail` command skips the first two lines, which are field headers and ASCII-art underlines.
< The result of all of this is piped to `sort` and `uniq` to eliminate duplicates, and saved to a file named `AUTHORS`.
< The next step is manual; in order for git-tfs to make effective use of this file, each line must be in this format:

> However, if you’d like to remove the identifier, now is the time to do so — before you start doing work on the new repository.
> You can use `git filter-branch` to remove the identifier strings en masse:
2695c571,575
< The portion on the left is the ``User'' field from TFVC, and the portion on the right side of the equals sign is the user name that will be used for Git commits.
